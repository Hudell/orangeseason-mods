  "I think probably every kid has wondered at least once, \\\"What do I want to be when I grow up?\\\"" : "",
  "There are as many answers to that question as there are stars in the sky." : "",
  "Plenty of dreams have been dreamed about becoming astronauts, movie stars, presidents and doctors." : "",
  "Me? I wanted to become a farmer." : "",
  "I guess it's kind of a weird thing for a kid to want to be. My parents were pretty sure I'd give up on it by the time I was twelve." : "",
  "But ever since I was little, that's been my dream... To have a piece of land I can call my own and make my living from it. I want to work the earth and enjoy the fruits of my labor...literally." : "",
  "Today, I'm taking the first step toward making that dream come true. With my parents' help, I've finally purchased a plot of land." : "",
  "Now I'm moving to Orange Town to start a new life as a farmer." : "",
  "To be honest, I'm kinda nervous. Will I make it big, or lose everything? What kind of hardships await me?" : "",
  "I don't know what's in store for me there, but I do know one thing..." : "",
  "I'm going to give it everything I've got!" : "",
  "(Dad said the mayor would meet me here, but I don't see anyone...)" : "",
  "Excuse me, are you <name>?" : "",
  "That's right. And you are...?" : "",
  "My name is Julia. As the mayor, allow me to officially welcome you to Orange Town, <name>." : "",
  "Your parents asked me to meet you at the station and show you around. If you'll come with me, I'll show you the way to your new farm." : "",
  "Here you are, home sweet home!" : "",
  "Your furniture and other belongings arrived here yesterday. You'll find them inside." : "",
  "Ah, you're here now. Thanks for taking the time to stop by, Benji." : "",
  "<name>, this is my younger brother Benjamin. He's also a farmer like you." : "",
  "If you need any help or advice, he'll be glad to help you out." : "",
  "Now, if you'll excuse me I should be going back to work..." : "",
  "Err... She doesn't talk much, does she?" : "",
  "She's just too busy these days. She talked a lot more when she wasn't mayor." : "",
  "At any rate, you didn't come to hear me ramble about my sister. You came here to farm." : "",
  "I brought you a farming handbook. Do you want me to go over it with you?" : "",
  "Yes, please!" : "",
  "No, I'll check the book later." : "",
  "No thanks, I'm already a good farmer." : "",
  "First things first: do you know how to walk around?" : "",
  "Yes, I know how to walk." : "",
  "Do I look like a toddler or something?" : "",
  "I came all the way here, didn't I?" : "",
  "No, I guess I don't." : "",
  "Well, no, but... You know, it's different from now on." : "",
  "You did, but it's different now." : "",
  "Well, it's not like you could figure this out on your own." : "",
  "What do you mean?" : "",
  "You need to press one of the <color:important><keys:up,left,down,right><color:default> to walk now." : "",
  "Oh. That makes sense." : "",
  "And when you want to talk to someone, open a door, pick an item or anything like that, you have to press the <color:important><key:ok><color:default>." : "",
  "Oh, the same key I'm using to skip this conversation?" : "",
  "Yes!<wait> Wait, what?" : "",
  "After I finished listening to you, of course!" : "",
  "Ah, ok.<wait> Well, if you want me to speak faster, you can hold the <color:important><key:ok><color:default> and I'll do my best." : "",
  "That will be useful!" : "",
  "Now, I noticed you've brought a rucksack with you. Good thinking. You can use it to store items and farming tools." : "",
  "I only brought it to carry a snack on the train." : "",
  "That's another good idea. To open your rucksack, press the <color:important><key:escape><color:default>. Then highlight an item and press the <color:important><key:ok><color:default> to take it out." : "",
  "But it's empty now. I already ate the snack." : "",
  "Then you can have mine. Here." : "",
  "Uhh...<wait> Were you planning on eating that later?" : "",
  "It's ok.<wait> Now, press the <color:important><key:ok><color:default> to pick up the apple." : "",
  "Then press the <color:important><key:pagedown><color:default> to place it in your rucksack." : "",
  "Good job." : "",
  "Does this mean I get to keep it?" : "",
  "I thought you had your snack already." : "",
  "Oh well, it was worth a try." : "",
  "Once you pick up an item or take it out of your rucksack, you can press the <color:important><key:use><color:default> to use it." : "",
  "When you need to use a farm tool, you can equip it from your rucksack by highlighting it and pressing <color:important><key:ok><color:default>." : "",
  "That's kind of slow. Isn't there a faster way to change tools?" : "",
  "There is. You can use the <color:important><key:pageup><color:default> to cycle through your available tools." : "",
  "You can also use the <color:important><key:pagedown><color:default> to cycle through your seeds and items." : "",
  "That's still kind of a pain. Is there an even faster way?" : "",
  "The fastest way to change tools is to use their hotkeys." : "",
  "Each tool has a numeric hotkey. Pressing that hotkey will automatically equip the right tool." : "",
  "Everytime you get a new tool you should check it's hotkey and maybe change it to something better on the settings." : "",
  "Anyway, once the tool is equipped, you can press the <color:important><key:use><color:default> to use it." : "",
  "How do I know what tool is equipped?" : "",
  "You...<wait> look at your hands?" : "",
  "Or look at the screen.<wait> Let me activate it for you." : "",
  "Isn't it better?" : "",
  "Now, here's a Hoe for you to use." : "",
  "Received a Perfect Hoe." : "",
  "I'll wait until you equip it." : "",
  "Good job. You'll be using many different tools as a farmer, so make good use of these shortcuts." : "",
  "Can I kee—<wait><close>" : "",
  "I'll need that hoe back now." : "",
  "Rats." : "",
  "Don't worry, I'll give you something better later." : "",
  "Oh, thanks. What will it be?" : "",
  "Later. Now, let's sow some seeds.<wait> Here." : "",
  "Received Turnip Seeds" : "",
  "Let's sow some seeds." : "",
  "Great Job! Now all that's left is to water what you've sown, but you can do that later with your watering can." : "",
  "But I don't have a watering can." : "",
  "What?<wait> How do you expect to be a good farmer without your own watering can?" : "",
  "I've never seen a farmer using a watering can. I thought you all relied on the rain." : "",
  "Not on this world, we don't. <wait> Here, I'll give you a basic watering can." : "",
  "Received a Watering Can." : "",
  "Don't forget to fill it, or you won't be able to water anything." : "",
  "Thanks. But I have one more question: Why can't I use a tractor to plow the land?" : "",
  "Do you have one?" : "",
  "For now, you'll have to till by hand using a hoe. Here." : "",
  "Received a Cheap Hoe." : "",
  "In exchange for those tools, I want you to bring me 5 turnips grown by you, any time you can. I'll even give you more seeds for that." : "",
  "Okay! I'll bring you the first 5 turnips I harvest." : "",
  "Perfect.<wait> I'll be going home now. Don't forget to water the seeds you've sown." : "",
  "I won't forget. Thank you for everything, Benjamin." : "",
  "Press the <color:important><key:ok><color:default> to pick up the apple." : "",
  "...Were you trying to use the hoe on me?" : "",
  "...No?" : "",
  "Then stop wasting time. Press the <color:important><key:use><color:default> on an empty patch of soil." : "",
  "I'm waiting for you to equip the hoe I just gave you." : "",
  "Now use it to till an empty patch of soil." : "",
  "Oh...<wait> Okay. Let me give you some tools, then." : "",
  "Received a Cheap Hoe, a Watering Can and 11 Bags of Turnip Seeds." : "",
  "In exchange for those tools, I want you to bring me 5 turnips grown by you, any time you can." : "",

  "Hello sweetie.<BR>I know you just moved out of here, but how's life on the farm so far?<BR>Yesterday your father said he wants to retire. They hired someone your age to be his boss and he isn't handling that very well.<BR>Hope to hear from you soon.<BR><BR>Love You.<BR>Mom.<BR><BR><BR>p.s.: I'm sending you a small gift." : "",
  "Hey, are you the new farmer my sister Julia was talking about?" : "",
  "Yup, that's me. The name is <name>." : "",
  "Welcome to Orange Town, <name>! My name is Brittany, I'm also a farmer here." : "",
  "Really? That's cool. Do you have any advice for me?" : "",
  "I don't work on the fields as much these days, but I can say it's important to eat a lot so you don't run out of stamina." : "",
  "There are many orange trees around the town. It's a good way to recover some energy. You can also sell them for some quick money." : "",
  "That's great advice. Thanks so much!" : "",
  "See you around, <name>." : "",
  "Hey there <name>, do you need anything?" : "",
  "If you need livestock or ranching supplies, you should talk to Stella." : "",
  "Sorry I didn't mean to be rude." : "",
  "Did you say something? Sorry, I just woke up." : "",
  "I'm really hungry right now." : "",
  "I get bored very easily, so I try to read a lot to keep my mind busy." : "",
  "I'm already tired. I think I'll go to bed soon." : "",
  "Hey <name>. Did you manage to sow all the seeds I gave you?" : "",
  "I noticed you found yourself a sickle. It will be very useful in the farm." : "",
  "If you ran out of space in your farm, you will need to find a sickle, hammer or axe to help clear the weeds, rocks and logs that are lying around." : "",
  "Try to explore the areas outside the town, you may be able to find something." : "",
  "Don't forget to water your crops every day." : "",
  "You can't rely on the rain alone. It would take too long for the crops to grow." : "",
  "You have a finite amount of energy to do farm work. Watering crops, chopping wood, tending to you animals — all of those things consume stamina." : "",
  "Working hard is part and parcel of life as a farmer, but if you push yourself too hard and run out of stamina, <color:important>you'll collapse<color:default>." : "",
  "Try to avoid becoming tired or sick if you can. Remember, early to bed and early to rise makes a farmer healthy, wealthy, and wise." : "",
  "If you need to buy seeds or other farming supplies, Serge is selling some of my excess stock in the general store." : "",
  "If you need livestock or ranching supplies, you should visit my sister Brittany's ranch and talk to Stella." : "",
  "Have you had a chance to go to the mountains yet? You can forage a lot of stuff there." : "",
  "To reach the mountains, go west through the path between the general store and my house." : "",
  "You probably know that already, since the train station is that way too." : "",
  "Have you been inside the big cave in the mountain base yet?" : "",
  "The Rock Town Miners may have abandoned it, but there's still a lot to find over there." : "",
  "You may even be able to find some useful tools there." : "",
  "I've seen you entering the mountain cave. Did you manage to find anything useful there?" : "",
  "The only thing I found there was a chest, but it was already open and completely empty." : "",
  "Well, well, well, what do we have here?" : "",
  "I'm <name>. I moved here to become a farmer." : "",
  "Farming? Oh my, what a dangerous occupation." : "",
  "You could put an eye out with that hoe, or lose a few fingers swinging that scythe around... Or catch a terrible illness from your cows..." : "",
  "You'll come see me when that happens, right? It won't be cheap, but I'll fix you up good as new." : "",
  "Um... I'll be careful, I promise." : "",
  "Aww... But I'm so lonely when I don't have any patients. And a girl's gotta make a living somehow, you know." : "",
  "Are you sure you won't fall and break your arm picking fruit? Or at least catch a cold from working too hard?" : "",
  "I'll...try to catch a cold sometime." : "",
  "You will? What a little darling you are." : "",
  "Anytime you're not feeling 100%, come see me at the clinic. Bonnie here will take good care of you, I promise." : "",
  "Working when you're tired will use up more stamina than normal, so you should go to bed early that night. Unless you're looking for an excuse to come see me in the clinic." : "",
  "You can come visit me even if you aren't sick, you know. I'll appreciate it." : "",
  "Yeah yeah, give it here." : "",
  "I have nothing else to say." : "",
  "Ah, now there’s a new face in town. Are you <name>?" : "",
  "Uh-huh. And you are...?" : "",
  "I’m Chloe. I heard all about you from Julia." : "",
  "Farming is dreadfully hard work. You’re certainly going to need plenty of calories to finish all those chores everyday." : "",
  "Come by the restaurant sometime and I’ll fix you something delicious, on the house. Call it my way of saying, \\\"Welcome to Orange Town.\\\"" : "",
  "Wow, thanks! I’ll definitely take you up on that!" : "",
  "If you're running low on stamina, you can recover it by <color:important>eating food<color:default>." : "",
  "Going to bed will also restore stamina, but if you stay up late, you won't get as much sleep. Your health will suffer too, and you may become <color:important>fatigued or ill<color:default>." : "",
  "How are you finding life here in Orange Town, <name>? Do you know your way around now?" : "",
  "Don't hesitate to speak up if you need something. We're neighbors now, and neighbors help each other out." : "",
  "What kinds of things do you like?" : "",
  "Have you had breakfast yet, <name>?" : "",
  "You need all the energy you can get to run that farm of yours. A good hearty breakfast will put a spring in your step." : "",
  "<name>, are you all right?" : "",
  "You need to sit down and grab a bite to eat." : "",
  "Here, I'll give you a full meal, on the house." : "",
  "<name>, you need to take better care of yourself." : "",
  "Make sure to get plenty of rest." : "",
  "Yo, are you <name>? The new farmer?" : "",
  "That's right, I'm <name>. But how did you know?" : "",
  "'Cuz there's a sign on your back that says, \\\"<name>, noob farmer.\\\"" : "",
  "I'm just messin' with ya. My dad told me." : "",
  "Add new key" : "",
  "Remove Button" : "",
  "Gameplay" : "",
  "From now on, I've gotta pick up the stuff you put in the shipping bin <color:important>every day at 8 AM<color:default>." : "",
  "Try not to ship too much, will ya? Hauling all of it back to the store is a pain in the ahhh--um, arms. Yeah. Arms." : "",
  "The biggest piece of advice I can give you is this: don't rush and do what you want." : "",
  "Farming isn't a race, and you can't miss out on anything. If you don't finish something today, you can always finish it tomorrow." : "",
  "And if you can't finish it tomorrow, there's always the next season." : "",
  "Yo <name>, getting used to your new life yet?" : "",
  "I have a lot of stuff to do today, but I just don't feel like it." : "",
  "Yo <name>, you free right now? Wanna go fishing or something? I hear the landsharks are biting." : "",
  "How's farm life treating you, <name>? If your crops aren't growing right, you gotta show 'em who's boss by stomping on them a bit." : "",
  "I mean, what kind of farmer takes sass from carrots and potatoes? Spare the root and spoil the chili, that's what I always say." : "",
  "Dad's always lecturing me about working harder and paying more attention... Red grapes, green grapes, what's the difference?" : "",
  "Did my brother tell you everything you need to know about life on the farm?" : "",
  "You can always look for him again to ask new questions. I'm sure he'll be happy to help." : "",
  "I'm so happy you moved here, <name>." : "",
  "Once upon a time, young people had little choice but to leave Orange Town in search of economic opportunity." : "",
  "But now, young people are moving here to start a new life. It warms my heart to see my hometown prosper." : "",
  "Hey <bro>, how are you?" : "",
  "I'm doing well. What about you?" : "",
  "Can't complain. Are you the new farmer?" : "",
  "Yes! The name is <name>." : "",
  "Nice to meet you, <name>. I'm Lucas." : "",
  "Nice to meet you too, Lucas." : "",
  "So. What do you do?" : "",
  "Not much. You?" : "",
  "I'm... a farmer." : "",
  "Ah, right." : "",
  "Don't mind me. I'm a simple guy who likes to stay home most of the time." : "",
  "Well hello there. Are you the new farmer in town?" : "",
  "That's right. I'm <name>." : "",
  "It's very nice to meet you, <name>. I'm Nathalia." : "",
  "If you need information about agriculture, please stop by the library. I'll introduce you to the glorious world of vast knowledge." : "",
  "Oh, but don't mind Pat-Pat. He's really a big soft and cuddly iddle-widdle baby, but most people seem to misunderstand him." : "",
  "I'll try to keep an open mind." : "",
  "Have you read any particularly engrossing novels lately, <name>? I would love a few recommendations." : "",
  "PatPat is just the sweetest most adorable widdle kitty-cat in the whole wide WORLD, isn't he?" : "",
  "Ahh, I could really go for a delectable sweet right now... I'm 98.25% sure my blood sugar could maybe be low or potentially going low right about now." : "",
  "I was thinking of procuring some new books for the library... What titles should I prioritize? It's such a dilemma..." : "",
  "Hello there. What's your name?" : "",
  "Didn't your mama teach you not to talk to strangers?" : "",
  "I'm not a stranger--I live here on a farm. I'm <name>." : "",
  "That's not how you introduce yourself. You're SUPPOSED to say, \\\"My name is <name>. It's nice to meet you.\\\"" : "",
  "My name is <name>. It's...nice to meet you." : "",
  "Very good. My name is Philomena, Phi for short. It's nice to meet you too, <name>." : "",
  "You should definitely buy a horse first thing. Horses are beautiful and awesome and riding is super-duper convenient." : "",
  "Oh, bananas! I forgot my wallet! ...Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to use such awful language." : "",
  "That's...a bad word? Bananas?" : "",
  "You better watch out, <name>. Mama's gonna wash your mouth out with soap at this rate." : "",
  "But...I'm a farmer..." : "",
  "What about coconuts?" : "",
  "Those are fine." : "",
  "Hello, Raphael." : "",
  "Oh, it's you. <name>, was it? Greetings." : "",
  "By the way, I'll stop by your farm later to bring you some welcoming gifts." : "",
  "Really? Thank you very much!" : "",
  "I'm Richard, why?" : "",
  "Hi Richard, I'm new here. My name is <name>." : "",
  "Ok, whatever." : "",
  "What is my brother doing? I want to hang out with him." : "",
  "If you see my little dog Pom anywhere, please let me know. Once I find her I'll go back home." : "",
  "If they sent you here to convince me to go home, foget it. I won't leave without my dog." : "",
  "Little Pom is probably scared somewhere, but I know she'll come back to me so I won't leave this place yet." : "",
  "If you see her anywhere, please let me know." : "",
  "Pom! You're finally here! Where have you been little girl?" : "",
  "Let's go home and play a lot! Wanna run?" : "",
  "This dog looks scared. Maybe she's lost? I should try to find her owner." : "",
  "This must be Pom. She looks really scared. I should bring her back to her owner." : "",
  "Welcome to Orange Town, <name>. I am Serge." : "",
  "My son Devin will pick up your shipping bin contents <color:important>every day at 8 AM<color:default>." : "",
  "If you need any supplies, please let me know." : "",
  "If you need any supplies, please visit the general store." : "",
  "Thanks a lot." : "",
  "Mmm. Good luck with your farm." : "",
  "My store will buy anything you place in the shipping bin. Shipments will be picked up by Devin at <color:important>8 AM<color:default>." : "",
  "If he doesn't show up to pick the shipments, let me know." : "",
  "If you see Devin slacking off at the store, please let me know." : "",
  "He's a good boy. If only he would follow your example and work hard on something..." : "",
  "Thanks for shipping your farm products to us, <name>. I appreciate the business." : "",
  "You're a hard worker, <name>. It's good to put your all into things. You'll go far in life with that attitude. If only my son would follow your example..." : "",
  "So you're the new farmer in town, huh? The name's Stella." : "",
  "I help out at Brittany's ranch and manage the store there. Stop by anytime you need to buy something." : "",
  "Thanks. Do you have any advice for me?" : "",
  "Advice? Get yourself a stiff upper lip and get ready to work." : "",
  "You'll be toiling from dawn to dusk every single day, rain or shine. I don't want to hear any complaining from you either. If you've got time to complain, you've got time to shut up and work." : "",
  "Work hard enough and you'll get ahead with a little bit of luck. And by luck, I mean work. You make your own luck in this life." : "",
  "Don't go relying on other people, either. The only person you can rely on yourself." : "",
  "I'll...keep that in mind." : "",
  "You do that. See you around, <name>." : "",
  "Gail's ranch is one of the finest in the peninsula. I'm proud to work alongside her." : "",
  "What, you need something?" : "",
  "Um...I just came over to say hi. I'm the new farmer here, <name>." : "",
  "Hey there. I’m kinda busy right now, so can you come back another time?" : "",
  "Sure thing... See you." : "",
  "...Nevermind, I guess I can spare a minute. So you're the new farmer, huh? Not to brag or anything, but I know a lot about growing crops." : "",
  "If I wasn't a blacksmith, I'd be the best farmer in town for sure. I'll be glad to take you under my wing, if you want. You'll be rolling in cabbage in no time flat, both the crunchy and spendable kind." : "",
  "I can also upgrade your tools for you <color:important>if you bring me the materials and money<color:default>. Stop by anytime." : "",
  "How are your tools holding up? Not getting dull or chipped, are they? If you need 'em repaired, you know where to bring 'em." : "",
  "I want to get Richard a little something nice, but argh... I'm no good at picking out kid stuff..." : "",
  "Man, I'm beat. Work just keeps piling up these days..." : "",
  "If there's something you don't know, just ask me. I'm pretty knowledgeable about all kinds of stuff, y'know. Whether it's farming, dating or mining, I've got all sorts of pro advice for ya." : "",
  "Do Nothing" : "",
  "Nothing" : "",
  "Hey little boy!" : "",
  "So where did you come from?" : "",
  "Is this dog yours?" : "",
  "Hello! Yes, it's mine." : "",
  "But actually, I brought him to Orange Town today because I have too many puppies already." : "",
  "This one seem to have liked you, do you want to keep him?" : "",
  "Sure! He seems like a funny fella. Does he have a name?" : "",
  "Not yet, you can choose a good one." : "",
  "<color:name><var:dogName></color>! What a great name!" : "",
  "Well, take good care of <color:name><var:dogName></color>...<wait>What's your name again?" : "",
  "It's <name>." : "",
  "Nice to meet you, <name>. My name is <color:name>Mia</color>. Take good care of <color:name><var:dogName></color>." : "",
  "<name>! Good timing!" : "",
  "What's going on?" : "",
  "Hello, <name>." : "",
  "Oh, hello there, Raphael." : "",
  "I've brought you that welcoming gift that I mentioned before." : "",
  "Oh, it's you. Raphael, was it? Greetings." : "",
  "Have you arrived to inspect the house? I hope you found it to your satisfaction." : "",
  "Yes, it's exactly what I requested. And you built it so quickly!" : "",
  "You're a really good carpenter." : "",
  "...If you say so. It's just a job I happen to have at the moment." : "",
  "Anyway, I've brought you a welcoming gift." : "",
  "Oh, thanks! What is it?" : "",
  "I'll give it to you in a minute, let me show you something else first. Come with me." : "",
  "Have you checked those fences, <name>? Did you know they can be removed by <color:important>pressing the action button twice?<color:default>" : "",
  "The same thing is true for gates. Even your barn and coop can be picked up by pressing the <color:important>action button twice<color:default>." : "",
  "How would I pick up a barn with my bare hands?" : "",
  "Just try it later and you'll see how easy it is. You can even put your buildings on your bag!" : "",
  "If you say so." : "",
  "Really, just try it and you'll see. Anyway, here's your gift." : "",
  "Use those gates to complete the fence around your barn." : "",
  "With a good fenced area, your animals will be completely safe from harm." : "",
  "<name>! Did you by any chance see the Saci just now?" : "",
  "That little prankster just ruined all of today's food." : "",
  "Who?" : "",
  "Oh, you don't know about the Saci?" : "",
  "Not really." : "",
  "He's a young prankster that lives in the forest near our town." : "",
  "Today he dropped flies on my food and spilled salt all over the kitchen." : "",
  "When I got into the kitchen, he disappeared in a whirlwind." : "",
  "In a whirlwind?" : "",
  "Yes. That's just one of his powers. Nobody ever managed to catch him because of it." : "",
  "Seems like a very annoying person." : "",
  "Yes. He's not really a bad guy and doesn't mean any major harm. But there's no minor harm that he won't do." : "",
  "Well, I have to go prepare more food. See you later, <name>." : "",
  "Where am I? This doesn't look like Orange Town." : "",
  "You there! Do you know where Orange Town is?" : "",
  "Uh... I just came from there." : "",
  "Alright." : "",
  "Ok, that was weird." : "",
  "Sorry, I forgot to thank you. Here, take this." : "",
  "What's this?" : "",
  "It's a magic ribbon. It will let you use magic." : "",
  "Woah, cool!" : "",
  "This is where I should put the animal feed." : "",
  "This bin is filled with animal feed. It should be enough to feed a grown cow or sheep for a day." : "",
  "I can put chicken feed here." : "",
  "This is chicken feed. It should be enough to feed a grown chicken for a day." : "",
  "<color:name><var:creatureName></color> looks <color:important>angry</color> today. Am I forgetting to feed her?" : "",
  "<color:name><var:creatureName></color> looks <color:important>upset</color> today. Did I do something wrong?" : "",
  "Good girl <color:name><var:creatureName></color>. You look very happy today." : "",
  "Good girl <color:name><var:creatureName></color>. Looks like you have produced some milk." : "",
  "<color:name><var:creatureName></color> didn't produce milk today. Did I do something wrong?" : "",
  "Good girl <color:name><var:creatureName></color>. Welcome to your new home." : "",
  "There there <color:name><var:creatureName></color>." : "",
  "There there <color:name><var:creatureName></color>. Welcome to your new home." : "",
  "Take fertilized egg?" : "",
  "Looks like an egg hatched. I should give this chick a name." : "",
  "A new member of my animal family. I have to work even harder now." : "",
  "Should I go to bed?" : "",
  "Not Yet" : "",
  "Not yet" : "",
  "Not yet." : "",
  "The festival hasn't started yet." : "",
  "Hello! Welcome to Orange Town's Chicken Festival." : "",
  "We would like to start the event now, are you ready?" : "",
  "Yes, let's start." : "",
  "Not yet. Please wait a minute." : "",
  "I'll wait, but hurry please." : "",
  "Congratulations on winning the race, <name>. Your prize will be delivered by mail. Look forward to it." : "",
  "Better luck next time!" : "",
  "Do you think you can participate next time, <name>? The race is much more fun with more people." : "",
  "If I go home now, I'll miss the rest of the festival..." : "",
  "Stay here" : "",
  "To raise a strong chicken, you need to let her roam free outside the coop." : "",
  "Make sure to make a well fenced area to protect them from wild animals." : "",
  "I knew you had it in you to become a great farmer! Your chicken is amazing." : "",
  "You lost? Are you sure you're taking good care of your chicken?" : "",
  "Next time I want to see a chicken from your farm running in the race." : "",
  "Hey <name>! Welcome to the chicken festival. Please, talk to Benji if you want to participate." : "",
  "Well done, <name>! You seem to be taking good care of your chicken." : "",
  "Your prize will be delivered by mail tomorrow morning." : "",

  "I once read a whole book of chicken facts. Did you know they have more bones in their necks than giraffes?" : "",
  "Hah, that was easy, wasn't it? Congratulations <name>." : "",
  "Your chicken was looking at me earlier. It felt like she was staring into my soul." : "",
  "I thought you were going to participate. Don't you have a chicken?" : "",
  "If you win the chicken festival, your farm's brand will get some recognition and I'll be able to sell your eggs for more." : "",

  "Why didn't you participate too? Devin's chicken is a lost cause, so I would be rooting for you." : "",

  "When I imagine a farm, the first animal I think of is always a chicken. Why do you think is that?" : "",
  "I have no idea what you have to do to train your chicken, but congratulations for doing it well." : "",
  "How can you even make the chickens run in a race? I thought they were going to just stay there, looking at each other." : "",
  "I'll deliver your rooster when the festival ends." : "",
  "Good morning, <name>. Today we are selling this magnificent rooster. Are you interested? The price is 5.000G" : "",

  "Today I had to leave Pat-Pat at home. He's friends with Agatha, but I don't want to risk having him near so many chickens." : "",
  "Look at that! I really won! It's all thanks to this book I've been reading." : "",
  "It's called 'How to make your Chicken win the Orange Town Chicken Race'." : "",
  "Well done, <name>. Congratulations for winning the race!" : "",
  "Hah. We both lost. I guess we need to study some more about how to properly raise a chicken." : "",
  "My little Agatha lost the race, but it's not a big deal. I'll study more and raise her stronger for the next year." : "",
  "Why is your chicken so... green?" : "",
  "I don't know. Maybe she hasn't matured yet." : "",
  "I don't think that logic applies to animals." : "",
  "I can't believe my Horse won! After so many years I finally won this race!" : "",
  "You mean your chicken?" : "",
  "Yeah, my chicken Horse." : "",
  "Is your chicken really called Horse?" : "",
  "Yeah! It's cool, right? It messes with people's heads." : "",
  "What would you call your horse if you had one?" : "",
  "I have one. It's called Turtle." : "",
  "Hello there. Perfect day for a festival, isn't it?" : "",
  "Your chicken is very happy that she won. I can tell she likes you." : "",
  "I had a lot of fun today. And I can tell that the chickens are happy too." : "",
  "Will you participate this time, <name>? I think my chicken Pipin has a chance this year." : "",
  "I knew it! My Pipin is the best chicken ever!" : "",
  "I lost again. I really thought this time things would be different..." : "",
  "It looks like everyone is taking good care of their animals. It fills my heart with joy." : "",
  "Hey <name>. I won this time, but you weren't bad either." : "",
  "I know you're taking good care of your animals, so keep competing and you'll eventually win." : "",
  "I never expected both of us to lose this competition." : "",
  "I'm really happy! Cocoa won the race again." : "",
  "Congratulations, <name>. I knew that if I were to lose this race, it was going to be to you." : "",
  "Oh, I didn't think I would ever see the day that my Cocoa would lose a chicken race." : "",
  "At the same time, I'm happy that people here are raising their animals well." : "",
  "When I was a kid, me and my friends used to throw eggs at each other as a prank." : "",
  "I remember one of them once slipped on a broken egg and ended up with a broken leg." : "",
  "That day was fun." : "",
  "Your chicken ran so fast in there. Near the end I thought she was going to jump to your face and peck your eye out." : "",
  "Well, there's always next year." : "",
  "Why did you lose? You should train your chicken better." : "",
  "Why aren't you participating? Do you think some chicken would peck your eye out?" : "",
  "Will you participate in the race, <name>?" : "",
  "Benjamin said that only adults can participate, so this year I can only watch it." : "",
  "Benjamin won't let me enter my chicken in the race. Ugh, he's such a green apple." : "",
